# Changes to be Made

## My fault
- Some How I made an animation error
- Buttons need to be centered Properly
- The Video div's are out of focus and look weird

## Modifications for personal skill growth
- Make this a PWA
- Add some some extra functionality for UX purposes:
    * a selected class for the Buttons,
    * default setting
    * some responsiveness
    * a stop Button
